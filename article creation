            There is a considerable amount of users that depend on a screen reader software to navigate the internet and only surf the internet through the use of the keyboard.<br>
        So making sure that screen readers can read each element, and that each of them can be accessed through the keyboard is ESSENTIAL, we have to code for all users.<br>
        Semantic HTML is not only about using the new semantic tags, but about using the correct tags for each element, so that it is easy to navigate for all users.

        <p>
            Using semantic HTML improves accessibility in two ways. The first is that itâ€™s better for mobile applications, because it requires less memory than non-semantic HTML. <br> The difference is not that significant for smaller apps, but certainly can play a role for larger websites. <br> Semantic HTML improves responsiveness because the browser can interpret the code better. Another reason why semantic HTML is so important for accessibility is because it greatly benefits screen reader users. <br> To ensure a smooth and seamless experience for everyone, including those with physical and cognitive disabilities. Semantic HTML helps achieve this by clearly defining different sections of a web page and maintaining consistency throughout the web.
